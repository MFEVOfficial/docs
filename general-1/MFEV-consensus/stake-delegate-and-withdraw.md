# Stake, Delegate and Withdraw

The basic requirement to become a MFEV Network validator is to have a stake amount of at least 100,000 MFEV Coin . The stake amount is the sum of staked and delegated MFEV Coin  of the address. **Roadmap** - Those functionalities will be built into our Studio and will not require any technical knowledge in the future.

## Stake <a href="#stake" id="stake"></a>

There are two options to stake (both should be called from the address which would be the validator)

1. 1.Send MFEV Coin  to the consensus contract -0xa0B4785393F6855b12F1bb99C58d8498E1E15cc2 on the MFEV Network .
2. 2.Call the \`stake\` function on the consensus contract -0xa0B4785393F6855b12F1bb99C58d8498E1E15cc2 on the MFEV Network.

## Delegate <a href="#delegate" id="delegate"></a>

MFEV Coin holders who don't want to run a node by themselves but still wish to participate in governing the network can delegate any amount to one of the validators. Delegating is done by calling the \`delegate\` function on the consensus contract (0xa0B4785393F6855b12F1bb99C58d8498E1E15cc2) with the validator address as data (see screenshot from MEW).

## Withdraw <a href="#withdraw" id="withdraw"></a>

Both stakers and validators can withdraw their MFEV Coin, up to the staked/delegated amount, at any time. The withdrawn amount will be deducted from the validator stake amount, and if the stake amount becomes below the minimum stake amount - the validator will be removed from the MFEV Network chain validators list. There are two options to withdraw:

1. Call the \`withdraw\` function on the consensus contract (0xa0B4785393F6855b12F1bb99C58d8498E1E15cc2) with one parameter - the amount to withdraw. This call is for stakers, and will reduce the stake amount of the sender address.
2. Call the \`withdraw\` function on the consensus contract (0xa0B4785393F6855b12F1bb99C58d8498E1E15cc2) with two parameters - validator address and amount to withdraw. This call is for both stakers (who can use their own address as the parameter) and for delegators to withdraw their delegated stake on a specific validator.
