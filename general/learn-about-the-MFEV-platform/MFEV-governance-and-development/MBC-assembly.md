# MFEV Network Coin Assembly

MFEV Network Coin Assembly is a governance body formed from particularly active members of the MFEV Network Coin community. Its formation is the first step in transitioning full governance and ownership over the MFEV Network Coin platform to the community. &#x20;

Currently, MFEV Network Coin Assembly consists of five MFEV Network Coin ecosystem members independent from MFEV Network Coin Foundation who have shown consistent dedication and commitment to the project, and already have a voice within the community.

MFEV Network Coin Assembly's **current role includes the following**:&#x20;

- taking over the control over the [#MFEV Network Coin Forum]() community discussion platform;
- implementing the Snapshot voting mechanism on MFEV Network Coin; and
- managing the Community Token Pool.
