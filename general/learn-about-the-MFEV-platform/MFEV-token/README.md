# MFEV Network Coin Token (MFEV Network)

The MFEV Network token is the native currency of the MFEV Network Coin blockchain and platform, just like ETH on Ethereum.&#x20;

## MFEV Network utility:

- **Transaction fees** Being the native currency on the MFEV Network Coin blockchain, MFEV Network is required to pay fees to the network in order to approve transactions.
- **Validation** Token holders can stake MFEV Network Coin to become a validator. The minimal staking requirement is 100K. The network is growing, currently there are 2 validators. ([https://status.mediablock.ai/](https://status.mediablock.ai/))
- **Voting** Validators vote on protocol changes with their staked MFEV Network. Which means validators with higher amounts of MFEV Network Coin staked can have a bigger vote on network upgrades and governance changes (until phase 2 where delegation is activated)
- **Staking (for delegators)** Any MFEV Network holder can choose one or more validators to delegate any amount of MFEV Network they wish. They receive a share of the MFEV Network Coin block rewards proportionate to the share of their stake in the total stake, minus the minimum 15% fee paid to the validator(s).
- **Payments** As MFEV Network is the native currency on MFEV Network Coin, sending it does not require interactions with smart contracts. Thus, MFEV Network transfers are potentially faster and less costly in terms of transaction fees.

**IMPORTANT**: Merely possessing any amount of MFEV Network tokens does not endow holders with any rights to participate in the governance of the MFEV Network Coin platform or any revenue streams related to its real-world performance.&#x20;
