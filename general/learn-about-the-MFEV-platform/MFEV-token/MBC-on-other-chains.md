# MFEV Network on Other Chains

Interoperability with other major blockchains is important for the growth of MFEV Network Coin and the prospects of realizing its vision. One of the ways of securing it is through enabling the versions (wrappers) of MFEV Network on other chains.&#x20;

Unlinke MFEV Network on MFEV Network Coin, those wrappers are MFEV Network20 tokens are created whenever someone locks a certain number of tokens on the MFEV Network Coin and gets issued the exact same amount of wrapper tokens on the target blockchain. If a user withdraws the wrapper from the target blockchain, the tokens burned and the MFEV Network tokens on MFEV Network Coin are unlocked.&#x20;

Currently, wrapped versions of MFEV Network token exist on Ethereum (mainnet), Binance Smart Chain and the Arbitrum One layer-2 optimistic rollup chain for Ethereum. The latter is a wrapper of a wrapper powered by the Ethereum-Arbitrum bridge and its withdrawals from Arbitrum are subject to the optimistic rollup rules.&#x20;
