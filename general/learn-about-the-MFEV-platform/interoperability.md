# Interoperability

The MFEV Network team strongly believes in interoperability among public blockchains. No single platform is likely to become fully dominant in the future.

Hence, interoperability solutions enabling transfers between MFEV Coin and other blockchains are vital for the continued growth of the MFEV Coin platform and ecosystem.

The MFEV Network team has been making considerable progress in getting MFEV Coin added by the leading operators. Currently the MFEV Network is connected to other blockchains via the following multichain bridges and value transfer protocols:

1\) Summary

&#x20;2\) The Elk Finance value transfer protocol.

3\) The Connext bridge (available to users via the xPollinate interface).

4\) The Multichain (formerly, Anyswap) bridge.

5\) The Allbridge bridge.

6\) The ChainPort bridge.

The ChainPort bridge connects MFEV Network to **Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain (BSC)**. Both bridges are custodial. The bridge to Ethereum is permissionless, while new tokens need to be added to the BSC bridge.

On both bridges, sending tokens from the relevant blockchain to MFEV Network is not subject to any fees or limits. Token withdrawals from MFEV Network incur a **0.05% fee** on the amount bridged. Users transferring funds also need to pay the fees on the destination chain in order to claim their tokens from the bridge contract at the final stage of the transfer.
