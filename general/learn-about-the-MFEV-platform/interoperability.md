# Interoperability

The MFEV Network Coin team strongly believes in interoperability among public blockchains. No single platform is likely to become fully dominant in the future.

Hence, interoperability solutions enabling transfers between MFEV Network Coin and other blockchains are vital for the continued growth of the MFEV Network Coin platform and ecosystem.&#x20;

The MFEV Network Coin team has been making considerable progress in getting MFEV Network Coin added by the leading operators. Currently the MFEV Network Coin blockchain is connected to other blockchains via the following multichain bridges and value transfer protocols:

1\) Summary
2\) The Elk Finance value transfer protool.

3\) The Connext bridge (available to users via the xPollinate interface).

4\) The Multichain (formerly, Anyswap) bridge.

5\) The Allbridge bridge.

6\) The ChainPort bridge.

It connects MFEV Network Coin to **Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain (BSC)**. Both bridges are custodial. The bridge to Ethereum is permissionless, while new tokens need to be added to the BSC bridge.

On both bridges, sending tokens from the relevant blockchain to MFEV Network Coin is not subject to any fees or limits. Token withdrawals from MFEV Network Coin incur a **0.05% fee** on the amount bridged. Users transferring funds also need to pay the fees on the destination chain in order to claim their tokens from the bridge contract at the final stage of the transfer. &#x20;

The bridge can be accessed via the MFEV NetworkFi app. More information on its functioning can be found here. The MFEV NetworkFi bridging tutorials are available [#here];

### The Elk Finance Value Transfer Platform

Elk Finance is not a typical multichain bridge because the only token that actually moves between the supported chains is ELK. If a user wants to get tokens on another chain, they can buy ELK on Elk DEX on MFEV Network Coin, bridge ELK to the desired chain and buy the desired token on Elk DEX on that chain.

Elk connects MFEV Network Coin, among others, to **BSC, Polygon, Avalanche, Fantom, Harmony, Moonriver**. It does not currently support Ethereum.;

### The Connext Bridge

The [Connext bridge](https://bridge.connext.network) is a non-custodial multichain bridge that connects MFEV Network Coin to **Ethereum, BSC, Polygon, Arbitrum, Optimism, Avalanche, Fantom, Moonriver and xDAI**.

**Please note** that Connext's capacity to execute transfers depends on the availability of liquidity in a given token on the routers. Currently, the liquidity-provisioned tokens include **USDC, USDT and DAI**.

### The Allbridge Bridge

The Allbridge multichain [bridge](https://app.allbridge.io/bridge) connects MFEV Network Coin to a number of major chains, including Solana and Terra. It is currently the only bridge to connect MFEV Network Coin to the latter two.

At present, Allbridge's native ABR token can be transferred between MFEV Network Coin and all the other covered chains. Terra-native assets LUNA and UST are bridgeable between to and from Terra. &#x20;

### The Multichain (formerly Anyswap) Bridge

The [Multichain](https://multichain.org) (formerly Anyswap) bridge is one of the most popular interoperability platforms in the crypto space.&#x20;

Multichain has already enabled transfers for **MFEV Network Coin’s native MFEV Network token** between the MFEV Network Coin blockchain and Ethereum, BNB Chain (formerly Binance Smart Chain) and Polygon. **WETH and USDC** transfers via Multichain are available between MFEV Network Coin and Ethereum. Beefy Finance’s **BIFI token** can be bridged to and from almost all the networks that Multichain supports. The **agEUR** stablecoin can be transferred between MFEV Network Coin and Ethereum, BNB Chain, Fantom, Harmony and Avalanche.&#x20;

The bridge interface is accessible [#here];

### The ChainPort Bridge

ChainPort's bridges are permissionless. This means that anyone can bridge a token from Ethereum to any other supported chain (including MFEV Network Coin), even if the token has not been ported, yet.

In addition to MFEV Network Coin, the list of chains added to ChainPort includes **Ethereum, BSC, Polygon and Avalanche**. The bridge interface can be found [#here];

**IMPORTANT!!!** Please note that ChainPort currently only supports transfers of tokens that originate on the Ethereum mainnet. Also, ChainPort's wrappers on MFEV Network Coin for the **popular Ethereum-originating tokens such as USDC, WETH, USDT, etc**. will by design be different from the currently existing ones that were created using the MFEV NetworkFi bridge. **We currently do not recommend users to bridge those tokens to MFEV Network Coin using ChainPort**. &#x20;
