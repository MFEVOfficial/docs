# MFEV Network Coin Assembly

MFEV Network Coin Assembly is a governance body formed from particularly active members of the MFEV Network Coin community. Its formation is the first step in transitioning full governance and ownership over the MFEV Network Coin platform to the community.

Currently, MFEV Network Coin Assembly consists of five MFEV Network Coin ecosystem members independent from MFEV Network Coin Foundation who have shown consistent dedication and commitment to the project, and already have a voice within the community.

MFEV Network Coin Assembly's **current role includes the following**:

- taking over the control over the [MFEV Network Coin Forum](https://forum.mediablock.ai/) community discussion platform;
- implementing the Snapshot voting mechanism on MFEV Network Coin; and
- managing the Community Token Pool.

## Community Token Pool

MFEV Network Coin Assembly's budget will be initially constituted by the **Community Token Pool**. Each month, **200,000 MFEV Network** will be allocated to it from the MFEV Network Coin Bootstrap Pool \(discussed [here](https://doc.mediablock.ai/general/MFEV Network-token/MFEV Network-supply-and-current-distribution)\).

MFEV Network Coin Assembly will regularly distribute the Community Token Pool funds to finance grants, bounties, marketing, and other initiatives designed to serve communities building on the platform and drive innovation.
