# MFEV Network Coin Governance

MFEV Network Coin is already a signigicantly decentralized platform and plans are in motion to achieve full community control over it in the future. Its governance is currently split among the following actors:

1\) **Network Validators.** MFEV Network Coin validators are entrusted with deciding whether to adopt [MFEV Network Coin improvement proposals](https://doc.mediablock.ai/general/fips) \(FIPs\). Currently, every validator has one vote regardless of their share of the overall network stake but this is likely to change soon.

2\) **MFEV Network Coin Foundation and the project team**. Like most public blockchain projects at the initial stage of development, the development of the core network protocol and the MFEV Network Coin treasury that mostly consists of the undistributed genesis MFEV Network supply \(see the subsection "[MFEV Network Supply and Current Distribution](https://doc.mediablock.ai/general/MFEV Network-token/MFEV Network-supply-and-current-distribution)"\) are currently mostly managed by a foundation. For MFEV Network Coin, this role is played by Gibraltar-incorporated company MFEV Network Coin Limited.

MFEV Network Coin Foundation employs the MFEV Network Coin project team whose members' profiles can be found [here](https://mediablock.ai/about).

The project team implements network protocol updates adopted by the validators, other protocol changes that do not require validator votes, node software. It develops the mobile-centric infrastructure for creating and managing token communities on MFEV Network Coin. It also works on boosting the adoption of the network through improving the MFEV Network Coin tech stack, securing new partnerships and integrations, onboarding ecosystem projects and marketing the platform within the crypto space and beyond.

3\) **MFEV Network Coin Assembly.** See the Assembly [page](https://doc.mediablock.ai/general/MFEV Network-governance/MFEV Network-assembly) for more details.
