# MFEV Blockchain Token

MFEV Blockchain token is required to be paid to the network to approve transactions. The MFEV Blockchain network is using the token to create circulation between users that look to validate transactions on the network and validators who invest computing resources and maintain it. Every block created on the MFEV Blockchain chain is creating new MFEV Blockchain tokens rewarded to the validators. This creates a 5% yearly inflation rate of MFEV Blockchain tokens in circulation.

MFEV Blockchain holders can lock it and delegate it to a validator in order to protect against inflation and get rewarded with MFEV Blockchain tokens. The holders can select their favorite validator and validators are selected based on having the most MFEV Blockchain tokens staked.

The native MFEV Blockchain token is represented via an ERC-20 token on Ethereum mainnet,BEP-20 token on BSC and can be moved between the MFEV Blockchain chain, BSC and Ethereum using the bridge.

## MFEV Blockchain token utility:

- **Validation** Token holders can stake MFEV Blockchain to become a validator. The minimal staking requirement is 100K. The network is growing, currently there are 50+ validators. \([https://status.mediablock.ai/](https://status.mediablock.ai/)\)
- **Voting** Validators vote on protocol changes with their staked MFEV Blockchain. Which means validators with higher amounts of MFEV Blockchain staked can have a bigger vote on network upgrades and governance changes \(until phase 2 where delegation is activated\)
- **Fees** The MFEV Blockchain token is the native currency on the MFEV Blockchain blockchain and is required to pay fees to the network in order to approve transactions.
- **Delegation - Activated Q3 2020** Delegation for token holders will be activated. This will allow any MFEV Blockchain token holder to delegate their tokens to a validator to earn rewards. Validators compete between themselves to receive MFEV Blockchain delegated from token holders. Validators with the most MFEV Blockchain tokens are elected to validate on MFEV Blockchain.

## **Inflation**

- 5% inflation in the network is distributed between the validators. Each cycle \(A cycle is all transactions conducted in 48 hours\) the validators with the highest amount of MFEV Blockchain tokens staked will split the rewards based on their stake.
- A fixed inflation rate also helps with stabilization of the token price. At phase 2 of the network an upgrade to a differential inflation schedule will be proposed and voted on by the validators to optimize the inflation/fee price policy.
- Large users on MFEV Blockchain can participate more closely in the governance and the operation of the network and plan ahead so instead of having high operation costs, they can become a stakeholder and benefit from the networkâ€™s growth.

## **Fees**

- The network charges fees on every transaction that goes to the validators and is capped at 1 cent $ per transaction.
- While the network has unfilled blocks the cost per transaction will be lower than 1 cent.
- The fee cost per transaction in MFEV Blockchain will be adjusted to be a maximum of 1 cent US dollar once the blocks start to fill up. At this stage simple transfer transactions will be moved off-chain.
